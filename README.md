# tabtacs
An implementation of the Table Tactics game designed by <a href="https://github.com/Faolan7">Faolan7</a>.

The rules are simple: Pieces move and attack each other.
One very special piece (the "Noble") is the kingpin of each player's army.
If a player loses their Noble, then they lose.
The last player standing wins.
