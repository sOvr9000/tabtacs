This model was trained for approximately `500,000` games against a randomly acting agent (RAA), totaling around `12` hours of computation.  On average, it is capable of winning `89%` - `91%` of its games against RAAs.

By `Replay #57`, the model reached an average win percentage of `90%` against RAAs over the previous `30` saved replays.  This means that after around `15,000` games, the agent made little improvement to its performance against RAAs.
